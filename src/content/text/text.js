export const aboutMe = `I am a Junior Developer who used to be a Senior Business Analyst in a large corporation for 8 years. 

From here, I enrolled in an Immersive Software Engineering Course to follow my passion for solving problems and to express my creativity by building useful and great looking applications. 

My career has been driven by my desire to learn, as demonstrated each time I moved on to a new role in my previous company. Today, I am looking at joining a team of developers where I can collaboratively work on projects and learn from my peers.`
